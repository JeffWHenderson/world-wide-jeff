In Spanish, common words that come before an infinitive verb fall into several categories. Here are the most frequent ones:

### 1. **Prepositions**
These are the most common triggers for an infinitive.

*   **`a`** (to, at) – Often indicates purpose or direction.
    *   *Voy **a comer**.* (I'm going to eat.)
    *   *Empezó **a llover**.* (It started to rain.)
*   **`de`** (of, from) – Often indicates cause, condition, or content.
    *   *Terminé **de trabajar**.* (I finished working.)
    *   *Trata **de entender**.* (He tries to understand.)
*   **`en`** (in, on) – Often indicates a simultaneous action or condition for a future action.
    *   *Tardó **en llegar**.* (He was slow to arrive / It took him a while to arrive.)
    *   *Insiste **en ayudar**.* (He insists on helping.)
*   **`por`** (for, because of) – Often indicates reason or something pending.
    *   *Lo hice **por ayudarte**.* (I did it to help you / for the sake of helping you.)
*   **`para`** (for, in order to) – Expresses purpose or destination.
    *   *Estudio **para aprender**.* (I study in order to learn.)
    *   *Es importante **para vivir**.* (It's important for living.)
*   **`sin`** (without)
    *   *Salieron **sin pagar**.* (They left without paying.)

### 2. **Modal/Periphrastic Verb Constructions**
These verbs are directly followed by an infinitive to form compound expressions.

*   **`poder`** (to be able to, can)
    *   *Puedo **nadar**.* (I can swim.)
*   **`querer`** (to want)
    *   *Quiero **viajar**.* (I want to travel.)
*   **`deber` / `tener que` / `hay que`** (must, have to, should)
    *   *Debo **estudiar**.* (I must study.)
    *   *Tengo que **ir**.* (I have to go.)
*   **`saber`** (to know how to)
    *   *Sabe **cocinar**.* (She knows how to cook.)
*   **`soler`** (to usually do)
    *   *Suelo **correr** por las mañanas.* (I usually run in the mornings.)
*   **`ir a`** (going to – for future)
    *   *Va **a llover**.* (It's going to rain.)

### 3. **Verbs of Emotion, Perception, or Beginning/Ending**
Many verbs that express these concepts are followed directly by an infinitive or by a preposition + infinitive.

*   **`gustar` / `encantar`** (to like / to love) – Often used with indirect object pronouns.
    *   *Me gusta **leer**.* (I like to read.)
*   **`ver` / `oír`** (to see / to hear)
    *   *Vi **llegar** al tren.* (I saw the train arrive.)
*   **`empezar` / `comenzar` a`** (to start/begin to)
    *   *Empezó **a cantar**.* (He began to sing.)
*   **`terminar` / `acabar` de`** (to finish)
    *   *Acabó **de escribir**.* (He finished writing.)
*   **`dejar` de`** (to stop doing)
    *   *Dejó **de fumar**.* (He stopped smoking.)

### 4. **Impersonal Expressions**
These often use `es` + adjective/adverb + preposition.

*   **`es fácil` / `es difícil`** (it's easy / it's hard)
    *   *Es fácil **decirlo**.* (It's easy to say it.)
*   **`es importante`** (it's important)
    *   *Es importante **beber agua**.* (It's important to drink water.)
*   **`es necesario`** (it's necessary)
*   **`es bueno` / `es malo`** (it's good / it's bad)
    *   *Es bueno **hacer ejercicio**.* (It's good to exercise.)

### 5. **Conjunctions**
*   **`al`** (upon, when) – A contraction of *a* + *el*.
    *   ***Al entrar**, saludó a todos.* (Upon entering, he greeted everyone.)
*   **`después de`** (after)
    *   *Después de **cenar**, veremos una película.* (After having dinner, we'll watch a movie.)
*   **`antes de`** (before)
    *   *Lávate las manos antes de **comer**.* (Wash your hands before eating.)

### Key Takeaway:
The most common structure is **Preposition + Infinitive** or **Conjugated Verb + Infinitive**. The specific preposition (if any) is determined by the preceding word (usually a verb or adjective), so it's often best to learn these as chunks (e.g., *aprender a hacer algo*, *soñar con viajar*, *es difícil de creer*).

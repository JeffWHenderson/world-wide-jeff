Masculine and feminine nouns in Spanish
Every noun in Spanish is either masculine or feminine. The good news? The difference is usually pretty clear! Most nouns that end in an -o are masculine, and most that end in -a are feminine. For a deeper dive, see our complete guide to Spanish nouns.

Un and una are indefinite articles in Spanish, similar to a, an, and the in English. You may have noticed that all the masculine nouns use un, while all the feminine ones use una. This is the case for all nouns.

Remember—in Spanish, the article must always match the noun.

So, you say un hombre (a man), and una mujer (a woman), but you’d never say un mujer or una hombre.

The same goes for definite articles el and la (“the” in English). They have to match the noun, just like un and una.

For example, in Spanish, a guitar is feminine, so it’s called la guitarra, but a bass guitar is masculine, so it’s el bajo.

In a few cases, the noun changes depending on the gender. If you want to say “the child,” you either say el niño if you’re talking about a boy or la niña if it’s a girl.

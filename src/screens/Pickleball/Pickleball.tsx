            The idea is to host a few meetup days to get people at the condo's tennis court.  If we start collecting enough people I'll start organizing with sign ups and maybe some actual effort into this webpage.

            It could also be tennis, I just think that would involve more skill matching, and I don't think I'm smart enought for that.
